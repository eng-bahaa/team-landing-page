# Project Charter  
## The Great Outdoors

---

## 1. Project Purpose / Background

The purpose of this project is to build a modern, user-friendly hiking website that serves as a trusted resource for both beginner and experienced hikers in the Pacific Northwest.

Our client has identified several challenges within the hiking community:

1. **New hikers struggle to find accurate, centralized, and up-to-date trail information**
2. **Popular trails are overcrowded, while lesser-known trails are underused**
3. **Many websites are outdated, difficult to navigate, or focused mainly on advertising gear rather than safety and stewardship**

This project will create a centralized web application that enables our client’s organization, **The Great Outdoors**, to grow and better serve hikers.
